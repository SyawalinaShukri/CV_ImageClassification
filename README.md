# CV_ImageClassification
 Assesment 1 for YP AI05 programme

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


* Computer Vision Project
* Image Classification
* Pre-trained Model: Transfer Learning
* Dataset: Concrete Crack Images for Classification
* Folder screenshots - include screenshots of model performance, tensorboard training process and model architecture results
* cv_image_classification.py - python project file (made in visual studio code)
* googleColab_cv_image_classification.ipynb - ipython or jupyter notebook file (made in google colab)
* The difference between the .py and .ipynb file is how the data is loaded
